## Overview üìù
Reliability assesslent of Power Electronic Modules is computationally slow, often relying on the notoriously slow Finite Element Simulations to obtain updates on the mechancial state of the module during its life time. 

This framework introduces: **machine learning surrogate models, replacing slow, high-fidelity simulations.** These surrogates replicate the simulation output with high accuracy while being up to **$10^6$ times faster**, making robust, cycle-by-cycle Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation practical.

[cite_start]Reliability assessment of power electronic modules (PEMs) is often slow and inaccurate, relying on methods that fail to capture non-linear damage accumulation[cite: 9, 10]. [cite_start]Autoregressive models are more robust but are crippled by the high computational cost of the required numerical simulations[cite: 11, 12, 67].

## Getting Started üöÄ

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher
* Conda or another virtual environment manager

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/MehdiGhrabli/ML4F.git](https://github.com/MehdiGhrabli/ML4F.git)
cd ML4F

# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
conda create -n ml4f python=3.9
conda activate ml4f

```

### 3. Download the Data

The simulation dataset used in the paper is located in the `/data` directory. [cite_start]It consists of 1000 simulation runs, mapping input conditions $(\Delta T, l_c)$ to the total strain field $(\epsilon)$[cite: 209].

### 4. Run the Main Showcase Notebook

To see the core results of the paper, run the main showcase notebook. This will train all the surrogate models and reproduce the performance comparison plots (e.g., Figure 9, 10) from Section 5.

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/2_Surrogate_Model_Showcase/2.2_All_Models_Engineered_Features.ipynb
```
